# AWS-Solution-Architect-Admin-DEPI-Track

Hello and Welcome to my repositry. My name is Yousef Hassan Eltobgy.
Here in this repo, I uploaded the two projects that I submitted as a graduation project for the AWS Solution Architect & Admin Track in DEPI. The Projects were made on AWS Academy.

- The First Project is the Building a Highly Available, Scalable Web Application. Here I used:
  - EC2 instances to host the web application.
  - I connected them to RDS instance to host the database for the web application.
  - I also deployed the instances in two availability zones.
  - I applied Auto Scaling groups to ensure high elasticity and availability.

- The Second Project is Securing and Monitoring Resources with AWS. Here I applied:
  - Security for data in Amazon S3.
  - Security for VPCs.
  - Security for AWS resources by using AWS KMS.
  - applied Monitoring and logging using AWS CloudTrail.

Inside the Folder of each Project, you will find a PDF file describing the steps followed in each project, and my certificate of completing the projects.
I also attached a file named "AWS Cloud Solution Admin & Architect - Projects - final - Yousef Eltobgy" for more details about the two projects and tasks made in them.
