# AWS-Solution-Architect-Admin-DEPI-Track

Hello and Welcome to my repositry. My name is Yousef Hassan Eltobgy.

Here in this repo, I uploaded the two projects that I submitted as a graduation project for the AWS Solution Architect & Admin Track in DEPI. The Projects were made on AWS Academy.

- I attached a file named "AWS Cloud Solution Admin & Architect - Projects - final - Yousef Eltobgy" for more details about the two projects and tasks made in them.
- You will also find a briefing presentation named "Project Presentation" that I made about what I did in the two projects.
  
- Inside the Folder of each Project, you will find a PDF file describing the steps followed in each project, and my certificate of completing the projects.
  - The First Project is the Building a Highly Available, Scalable Web Application. Here:
    - I launched EC2 instances to host the web application.
    - I connected them to RDS instance to host the database for the web application.
    - I also deployed the instances in two availability zones.
    - I applied Auto Scaling groups to ensure high elasticity and availability.
      
  - The Second Project is Securing and Monitoring Resources with AWS. Here I applied:
    - Security for data in Amazon S3.
    - Security for VPCs.
    - Security for AWS resources by using AWS KMS.
    - Applied Monitoring and logging using AWS CloudTrail.
